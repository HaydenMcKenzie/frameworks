## SWOT + TOWS
# Simple Explanation
SWOT identifies internal Strengths and Weaknesses, and external Opportunties and Threats. TOWS turns those into strategies.

# Complex Explanation
SWOT is an analytical tool to categorize company attributes and environmental factors. TOWS builds on this by mapping combinations (e.g. Strength-Oppotunity) to develop strategic options.

# Example
### Tech Startup
- Strength: Agile Development
- Weakness: Limited Funding
